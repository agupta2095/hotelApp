# Final Project
The goal of the final project is to implement a website with a subset of the functionality of tripadvisor (or oyster.com, hotels.com), where users can register, login, search for hotels, read reviews written by other people, write and edit their own reviews, etc. Note that this website will not allow the user to check availability or book hotels.

Projects Features
1. The website used an SQL server to store the details of users, and hotels and used multi-threading to process various the requests asynchronously.
2. Added pagination on the client side.
3. Used Bootsrap and CSS, Javascript for the front-end web development
